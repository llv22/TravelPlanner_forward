To adjust the plan to fit the budget, we need to make some changes:\n\n- Choose a less expensive accommodation that allows parties.\n- Opt for more budget-friendly dining options.\n- Consider alternative transportation options if available within the budget.\n\nGiven the constraints and the available reference information, it is not possible to create a travel itinerary that includes accommodations where parties are allowed and stays within the $1000 budget. The accommodation alone exceeds the budget on the first day. To proceed, we would need to either increase the budget or adjust the requirements regarding accommodations and other expenses.", "gpt-4-1106-preview_direct_sole-planning_parsed_results": [{"day": 1, "current_city": "from Jacksonville to Washington", "transportation": "Flight Number: F3635008, from Jacksonville to Washington, Departure Time: 16:58, Arrival Time: 18:44", "breakfast": "-", "attraction": "The Seattle Great Wheel, Washington", "lunch": "-", "dinner": "Los Aztecas, Washington", "accommodation": "Comfortable & Cozy Times Square Apt, Washington"}, {"day": 2, "current_city": "Washington", "transportation": "-", "breakfast": "Manna Java World Cafe, Washington", "attraction": "Space Needle, Washington", "lunch": "Hemingway's Island Grill, Washington", "dinner": "Thaaliwala, Washington", "accommodation": "Comfortable & Cozy Times Square Apt, Washington"}, {"day": 3, "current_city": "from Washington to Jacksonville", "transportation": "Flight Number: F3786730, from Washington to Jacksonville, Departure Time: 08:48, Arrival Time: 10:58", "breakfast": "Cafe Coffee Day, Washington", "attraction": "-", "lunch": "-", "dinner": "-", "accommodation": "-"}]}]
