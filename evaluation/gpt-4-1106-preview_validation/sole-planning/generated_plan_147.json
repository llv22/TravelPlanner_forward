To adjust, we can consider changing accommodations to more affordable options, reducing meal costs, or altering attractions. Additionally, the accommodation chosen for Tucson does not allow visitors, which is against the query's requirements. However, due to the lack of information on accommodations that allow visitors, this was the best match available.
