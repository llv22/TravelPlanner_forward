Given the constraints, it is not possible to create a travel plan within the $2,000 budget that includes flights, diverse meals, and accommodations that allow visitors. We would need to either increase the budget or adjust the requirements (e.g., consider different travel dates, choose budget accommodations, limit dining options, or explore alternative transportation methods).", "gpt-4-1106-preview_direct_sole-planning_parsed_results": [{"day": 1, "current_city": "from Los Angeles to Detroit", "transportation": "Flight Number: F3496477, from Los Angeles to Detroit, Departure Time: 15:30, Arrival Time: 22:51", "breakfast": "-", "attraction": "Detroit Riverwalk, Detroit;", "lunch": "-", "dinner": "Chye Seng Huat Hardware, Detroit", "accommodation": "Cozy 1 bedroom in the heart of Fort Greene, Detroit"}, {"day": 2, "current_city": "Detroit", "transportation": "-", "breakfast": "A Dong Restaurant, Detroit", "attraction": "Detroit Institute of Arts, Detroit;", "lunch": "The Dosa King, Detroit", "dinner": "Bistro Flamme Bois, Detroit", "accommodation": "Lovely, charming and clean bedroom in Manhattan, Detroit"}, {"day": 3, "current_city": "from Detroit to Los Angeles", "transportation": "Flight Number: F3545846, from Detroit to Los Angeles, Departure Time: 13:31, Arrival Time: 15:14", "breakfast": "Southern Bliss Bakery, Detroit", "attraction": "Belle Isle Aquarium, Detroit;", "lunch": "DV's Chinese Kitchen, Detroit", "dinner": "-", "accommodation": "-"}]}]
