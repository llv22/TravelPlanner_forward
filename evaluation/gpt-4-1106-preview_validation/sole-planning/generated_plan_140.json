To further reduce costs, we can opt for a cheaper dinner option on Day 1:\n\nRevised Dinner Day 1: Spooky Sky, Phoenix, Cost: $15, Cuisines: \"Tea, Pizza, Fast Food, Cafe, Indian\"\n\nRevised Total Cost for Day 1: 2 * 34 + 2 * 15 + 468 = $1062\n\nRevised Total Cost across all days = $1062 (Day 1) + $635 (Day 2) + $116 (Day 3) = $1813\n\nThe revised total cost is now $1813, which is within the specified budget of $1,900.", "gpt-4-1106-preview_direct_sole-planning_parsed_results": [{"day": 1, "current_city": "from El Paso to Phoenix", "transportation": "Self-driving, from El Paso to Phoenix, duration: 6 hours 15 mins, distance: 692 km", "breakfast": "-", "attraction": "-", "lunch": "-", "dinner": "Doughlicious, Phoenix", "accommodation": "Bright, Williamsburg bedroom with private balcony, Phoenix"}, {"day": 2, "current_city": "Phoenix", "transportation": "-", "breakfast": "Pizza Hut, Phoenix", "attraction": "Desert Botanical Garden, Phoenix", "lunch": "Mama Loca, Phoenix", "dinner": "Enigma Lounge, Phoenix", "accommodation": "Bright, Williamsburg bedroom with private balcony, Phoenix"}, {"day": 3, "current_city": "from Phoenix to El Paso", "transportation": "Self-driving, from Phoenix to El Paso, duration: 6 hours 17 mins, distance: 694 km", "breakfast": "Cafe Amigo, Phoenix", "attraction": "Heard Museum, Phoenix", "lunch": "-", "dinner": "-", "accommodation": "-"}]}]
