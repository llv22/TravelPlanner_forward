Attractions were chosen based on their uniqueness and popularity. The accommodation in Houston has a minimum stay of 2 nights, which aligns with the stay. The accommodation in Dallas has a minimum stay of 4 nights, but since the itinerary only allows for a 2-night stay, the next best option with a 2-night minimum was chosen.
