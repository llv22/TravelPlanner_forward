To adjust the plan to fit the budget, we can make the following changes:\n\n- Choose a less expensive accommodation in Houston. For example, instead of \"Sunny and Airy near Manhattan\" at $499 per night, we could choose \"1BR in Newly Renovated Apartment - Rm C, Bushwick!\" at $288 per night. This would save $422 over two nights.\n- Opt for more budget-friendly meal options, reducing the average meal cost to around $20 per meal. This could save approximately $100 over the course of the trip.\n- Choose a less expensive accommodation in Dallas. For example, instead of \"*Fresh Budget Room\" at $262 per night, we could choose \"Huge Private Room Near Prospect Park\" at $73 per night. This would save $378 over two nights.\n\nWith these adjustments, the new estimated total cost would be $2,551 - $422 - $100 - $378 = $1,651, which is within the budget of $2,100.", "gpt-4-1106-preview_direct_sole-planning_parsed_results": [{"day": 1, "current_city": "from Albuquerque to Houston", "transportation": "Flight Number: F3884406, from Albuquerque to Houston, Departure Time: 07:41, Arrival Time: 10:35", "breakfast": "-", "attraction": "Space Center Houston, Houston", "lunch": "Jalapenos, Houston", "dinner": "Super Bakery, Houston", "accommodation": "Sunny and Airy near Manhattan, Houston"}, {"day": 2, "current_city": "Houston", "transportation": "-", "breakfast": "Earthen Spices, Houston", "attraction": "Houston Museum of Natural Science, Houston", "lunch": "Sheetla Dhaba, Houston", "dinner": "The BrewMaster - The Mix Fine Dine, Houston", "accommodation": "Sunny and Airy near Manhattan, Houston"}, {"day": 3, "current_city": "from Houston to Dallas", "transportation": "Flight Number: F3718973, from Houston to Dallas, Departure Time: 12:09, Arrival Time: 13:05", "breakfast": "Cyber Adda 24, Houston", "attraction": "The Sixth Floor Museum at Dealey Plaza, Dallas", "lunch": "Coconuts Fish Cafe, Dallas", "dinner": "1918 Bistro & Grill, Dallas", "accommodation": "Fresh Budget Room, Dallas"}, {"day": 4, "current_city": "Dallas", "transportation": "-", "breakfast": "Cafe Gatherings, Dallas", "attraction": "Reunion Tower, Dallas", "lunch": "Drifters Cafe, Dallas", "dinner": "Uma Foodies' Hut, Dallas", "accommodation": "Fresh Budget Room, Dallas"}, {"day": 5, "current_city": "from Dallas to Albuquerque", "transportation": "Flight Number: F3960534, from Dallas to Albuquerque, Departure Time: 18:54, Arrival Time: 19:35", "breakfast": "Metro Fast Food, Dallas", "attraction": "Dallas Museum of Art, Dallas", "lunch": "MONKS, Dallas", "dinner": "-", "accommodation": "-"}]}]
