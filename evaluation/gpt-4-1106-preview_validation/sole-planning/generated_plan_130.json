To adjust the plan within the budget, we need to make some changes:\n\n- Choose a less expensive accommodation that allows parties. However, the provided data does not include a cheaper option that meets the party requirement.\n- Reduce the number of paid attractions and opt for free activities.\n- Choose more budget-friendly dining options.\n\nGiven the constraints and the available data, it is not possible to create a travel plan that includes accommodations allowing parties, diverse meals, and attractions within the $1,500 budget for two people. We would need to either increase the budget or adjust the requirements to create a feasible plan.", "gpt-4-1106-preview_direct_sole-planning_parsed_results": [{"day": 1, "current_city": "from South Bend to Atlanta", "transportation": "Flight Number: F3648988, from South Bend to Atlanta, Departure Time: 12:30, Arrival Time: 14:21", "breakfast": "-", "attraction": "Georgia Aquarium, Atlanta;", "lunch": "Daawat-e-Kashmir, Atlanta", "dinner": "Chef Style, Atlanta", "accommodation": "Bright central designer's apt - steps to train!, Atlanta"}, {"day": 2, "current_city": "Atlanta", "transportation": "-", "breakfast": "Included in accommodation", "attraction": "World of Coca-Cola, Atlanta;High Museum of Art, Atlanta;", "lunch": "Pizza Central, Atlanta", "dinner": "The Chinese & Thai Restaurant, Atlanta", "accommodation": "Bright central designer's apt - steps to train!, Atlanta"}, {"day": 3, "current_city": "from Atlanta to South Bend", "transportation": "Flight Number: F3637050, from Atlanta to South Bend, Departure Time: 10:26, Arrival Time: 12:06", "breakfast": "Included in accommodation", "attraction": "Centennial Olympic Park, Atlanta;", "lunch": "Saffron, Atlanta", "dinner": "-", "accommodation": "-"}]}]
