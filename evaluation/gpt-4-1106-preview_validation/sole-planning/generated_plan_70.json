To adjust the plan within the budget, we need to make some changes:\n\n- We can switch to a less expensive accommodation option for Day 1 and Day 2. Let's choose \"Cozy, Private room\" which costs 184 per night and has a maximum occupancy of 2.\n- We will also need to remove one of the attractions or meals to stay within the budget.\n\nRevised Total Cost Calculation:\nDay 1: 8 * 211 (flight) + 8 * 87 (dinner) + 4 * 184 (accommodation) = 1688 + 696 + 736 = 3120\nDay 2: 8 * 70 (breakfast) + 8 * 96 (lunch) + 8 * 87 (dinner) + 4 * 184 (accommodation) = 560 + 768 + 696 + 736 = 2760\nDay 3: 8 * 124 (flight) + 8 * 70 (breakfast) + 8 * 96 (lunch) = 992 + 560 + 768 = 2320\n\nRevised Total cost across all days = 3120 + 2760 + 2320 = 8200\n\nThe revised plan still exceeds the budget. Further adjustments are needed:\n\n- We can remove the lunch on Day 2 and Day 3 to save costs.\n\nFinal Revised Total Cost Calculation:\nDay 1: 1688 (flight) + 696 (dinner) + 736 (accommodation) = 3120\nDay 2: 560 (breakfast) + 696 (dinner) + 736 (accommodation) = 1992\nDay 3: 992 (flight) + 560 (breakfast) = 1552\n\nFinal Revised Total cost across all days = 3120 + 1992 + 1552 = 6664\n\nThe final revised plan is slightly over the budget by $64. To accommodate this, we can opt for a slightly cheaper breakfast option on one of the days or negotiate a group discount for the flights or accommodation.", "gpt-4-1106-preview_direct_sole-planning_parsed_results": [{"day": 1, "current_city": "from Valparaiso to Belleville", "transportation": "Flight Number: F3579167, from Valparaiso to Belleville, Departure Time: 17:23, Arrival Time: 19:06", "breakfast": "-", "attraction": "Belleville Square, Belleville", "lunch": "-", "dinner": "Asian Haus, Belleville", "accommodation": "1 Bedroom/1 Bath Apt in Hudson Yards/Midtown West, Belleville"}, {"day": 2, "current_city": "Belleville", "transportation": "-", "breakfast": "Fuji Japanese Steak House, Belleville", "attraction": "National Shrine of Our Lady of the Snows, Belleville", "lunch": "Super Restaurant, Belleville", "dinner": "Asian Haus, Belleville", "accommodation": "1 Bedroom/1 Bath Apt in Hudson Yards/Midtown West, Belleville"}, {"day": 3, "current_city": "from Belleville to Valparaiso", "transportation": "Flight Number: F3571908, from Belleville to Valparaiso, Departure Time: 17:15, Arrival Time: 18:55", "breakfast": "Fuji Japanese Steak House, Belleville", "attraction": "Labor & Industrial Museum, Belleville", "lunch": "Super Restaurant, Belleville", "dinner": "-", "accommodation": "-"}]}]
