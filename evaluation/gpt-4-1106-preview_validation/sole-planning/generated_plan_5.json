The \"Unique 2BR Apartment\" at $394 per night fits within the budget for two nights, totaling $788.\n\nRevised Budget Breakdown:\n- Flight to Atlanta: $137\n- Flight back to West Palm Beach: $180\n- Accommodation (2 nights at $394 per night): $788\n- Meals and Attractions: $260\nTotal: $1365\n\nThe revised budget still exceeds the $900 limit. We need to make further adjustments. Let's choose the \"Charming Carroll Gardens 2 BR\" for accommodation, which is $576 for two nights.\n\nFinal Budget Breakdown:\n- Flight to Atlanta: $137\n- Flight back to West Palm Beach: $180\n- Accommodation (2 nights at $576): $576\n- Meals and Attractions: $260\nTotal: $1153\n\nThe budget is still over $900. We will need to cut down on meal costs or choose a cheaper flight or accommodation. Since the flights and accommodation are the cheapest options available in the provided data, we will reduce meal costs by choosing less expensive restaurants.\n\nFinal Adjusted Budget Breakdown:\n- Flight to Atlanta: $137\n- Flight back to West Palm Beach: $180\n- Accommodation (2 nights at $576): $576\n- Meals and Attractions: Adjusted to $7 per meal (3 meals a day for 2 days) and $20 per attraction, the total for 6 meals and 4 attractions would be approximately $102.\n\nTotal: $995\n\nThe budget is still slightly over $900. To fit within the budget, we can remove one attraction, reducing the cost by $20.\n\nTotal: $975\n\nWe are still over budget. Since we cannot adjust flights or accommodation further without changing the dates or quality of the stay, and since the meals are already budgeted very modestly, we would need to either increase the budget or shorten the trip to fit within $900.", "gpt-4-1106-preview_direct_sole-planning_parsed_results": [{"day": 1, "current_city": "from West Palm Beach to Atlanta", "transportation": "Flight Number: F3491626, from West Palm Beach to Atlanta, Departure Time: 13:56, Arrival Time: 16:02", "breakfast": "-", "attraction": "Georgia Aquarium, Atlanta;", "lunch": "Saffron, Atlanta", "dinner": "Baba Au Rhum, Atlanta", "accommodation": "Fantastic Room in Bushwick, Atlanta"}, {"day": 2, "current_city": "Atlanta", "transportation": "-", "breakfast": "Adda, Atlanta", "attraction": "Atlanta Botanical Garden, Atlanta;World of Coca-Cola, Atlanta;", "lunch": "Asian Bistro, Atlanta", "dinner": "Pizza Central, Atlanta", "accommodation": "Fantastic Room in Bushwick, Atlanta"}, {"day": 3, "current_city": "from Atlanta to West Palm Beach", "transportation": "Flight Number: F3495052, from Atlanta to West Palm Beach, Departure Time: 15:04, Arrival Time: 16:37", "breakfast": "Daawat-e-Kashmir, Atlanta", "attraction": "Piedmont Park, Atlanta;", "lunch": "-", "dinner": "-", "accommodation": "-"}]}]
