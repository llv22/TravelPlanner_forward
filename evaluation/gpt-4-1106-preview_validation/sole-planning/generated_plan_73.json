To adjust the plan within the budget, we need to make some changes:\n\n1. Change the accommodation to a more affordable option.\n2. Remove one of the attractions or meals to save costs.\n\nRevised Travel Plan:\n\nDay 1: March 13, 2022\nAccommodation: Brooklyn Charmer, Close to Everything NYC!, Huntsville, Cost: $568, Maximum Occupancy: 5, House Rules: No children under 10 & No parties\n\nDay 2: March 14, 2022\nNo changes to meals or attractions.\n\nDay 3: March 15, 2022\nNo changes to transportation.\n\nRevised Total Cost:\nDay 1: $676 (Flight) + $328 (Lunch) + $296 (Dinner) + $568 (Accommodation) = $1868\nDay 2: $324 (Breakfast) + $64 (Lunch) + $308 (Dinner) = $696\nDay 3: $580 (Flight)\nRevised Total = $1868 + $696 + $580 = $3144\n\nThe revised total still exceeds the budget. Further adjustments are needed:\n\n1. Choose the cheapest flight options.\n2.

To fit within the $2,700 budget, we may need to consider self-driving or taking a taxi, and further reduce meal costs or attractions.\n\nSelf-driving Cost:\nDay 1: Self-driving, from Dallas to Huntsville, Cost: $53\n\nRevised Total Cost with Self-driving:\nDay 1: $53 (Self-driving) + $328 (Lunch) + $296 (Dinner) + $568 (Accommodation) = $1245\nDay 2: $696 (Meals)\nDay 3: $53 (Self-driving)\nRevised Total = $1245 + $696 + $53 = $1994\n\nThe revised total with self-driving is $1994, which is within the budget. However, the self-driving option will take significantly longer (10 hours 10 mins), which may not be feasible for the travelers. If self-driving is not an option due to time constraints, further adjustments to meals and attractions will be necessary to fit the budget.", "gpt-4-1106-preview_direct_sole-planning_parsed_results": [{"day": 1, "current_city": "from Dallas to Huntsville", "transportation": "Flight Number: F3609558, from Dallas to Huntsville, Departure Time: 07:03, Arrival Time: 08:51", "breakfast": "-", "attraction": "U.S. Space & Rocket Center, Huntsville;", "lunch": "El Vaquero Mexican Restaurant, Huntsville", "dinner": "Downtown Grill, Huntsville", "accommodation": "Brooklyn Charmer, Close to Everything NYC!, Huntsville"}, {"day": 2, "current_city": "Huntsville", "transportation": "-", "breakfast": "Breakfast Hut, Huntsville", "attraction": "Huntsville Botanical Garden, Huntsville;", "lunch": "Cherry Comet, Huntsville", "dinner": "Moksh The Restro Lounge, Huntsville", "accommodation": "Artsy Harlem Guest Space, Huntsville"}, {"day": 3, "current_city": "from Huntsville to Dallas", "transportation": "Flight Number: F3593796, from Huntsville to Dallas, Departure Time: 09:26, Arrival Time: 11:26", "breakfast": "-", "attraction": "-", "lunch": "-", "dinner": "-", "accommodation": "-"}]}]
