This could include choosing more affordable accommodations, dining options, or reducing the number of attractions visited. Additionally, the cost of accommodations seems to be calculated per person, which is unusually high; typically, accommodation prices are per room or unit, not per person. This needs to be clarified and adjusted to reflect a more realistic cost. If the accommodation costs are indeed per room/unit and can accommodate all 5 travelers, the revised total cost would be significantly lower and may fit within the budget.", "gpt-4-1106-preview_direct_sole-planning_parsed_results": [{"day": 1, "current_city": "from Marquette to Escanaba", "transportation": "Self-driving, from Marquette to Escanaba, Duration: 3 hours 34 mins, Distance: 362 km, Cost: 18", "breakfast": "-", "attraction": "Ludington Park, Escanaba", "lunch": "Machine Shed Restaurant, Escanaba", "dinner": "The Grand Marlin, Escanaba", "accommodation": "California Vibes in NYC, Escanaba"}, {"day": 2, "current_city": "Escanaba", "transportation": "-", "breakfast": "Butter & Grace, Escanaba", "attraction": "Delta County Historical Society, Escanaba", "lunch": "Makhmali Kebabs, Escanaba", "dinner": "Pant Ice Cream Parlour, Escanaba", "accommodation": "California Vibes in NYC, Escanaba"}, {"day": 3, "current_city": "from Escanaba to Pellston", "transportation": "Self-driving, from Escanaba to Pellston, Duration: 2 hours 43 mins, Distance: 262 km, Cost: 13", "breakfast": "-", "attraction": "Pellston Pioneer Park, Pellston", "lunch": "Aroos Damascus, Pellston", "dinner": "The Great Kabab Factory - Park Plaza, Pellston", "accommodation": "Designer's Beautiful 2BR Apartment in NOLITA/SOHO, Pellston"}, {"day": 4, "current_city": "Pellston", "transportation": "-", "breakfast": "Johnnie Mars, Pellston", "attraction": "Headlands International Dark Sky Park, Pellston", "lunch": "Flame & Grill, Pellston", "dinner": "Spezia Bistro, Pellston", "accommodation": "Designer's Beautiful 2BR Apartment in NOLITA/SOHO, Pellston"}, {"day": 5, "current_city": "from Pellston to Detroit", "transportation": "Flight Number: F3832610, from Pellston to Detroit, Departure Time: 14:06, Arrival Time: 15:03, Cost: 121", "breakfast": "-", "attraction": "Detroit Institute of Arts, Detroit", "lunch": "A Dong Restaurant, Detroit", "dinner": "BMG - All Day Dining, Detroit", "accommodation": "Cozy 1 bedroom in the heart of Fort Greene, Detroit"}, {"day": 6, "current_city": "Detroit", "transportation": "-", "breakfast": "Cafe And More, Detroit", "attraction": "Michigan Science Center, Detroit", "lunch": "The Dosa King, Detroit", "dinner": "Vapour Pub & Brewery, Detroit", "accommodation": "Cozy 1 bedroom in the heart of Fort Greene, Detroit"}, {"day": 7, "current_city": "from Detroit to Marquette", "transportation": "Flight Number: F3846022, from Detroit to Marquette, Departure Time: 13:35, Arrival Time: 14:51, Cost: 118", "breakfast": "-", "attraction": "-", "lunch": "-", "dinner": "-", "accommodation": "-"}]}]
