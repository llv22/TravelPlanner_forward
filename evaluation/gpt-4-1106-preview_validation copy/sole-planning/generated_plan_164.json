To fit within the budget, we would need to make adjustments such as choosing more affordable restaurants, finding cheaper accommodations, and possibly reducing the number of attractions visited or finding free activities. Additionally, the cost of self-driving has been calculated based on a per person rate, which may not be accurate as the cost of fuel and car rental would likely be split among the group, not charged individually.
