It is $1376 + $388 + $246 = $2010\n\nHowever, the total cost exceeds the budget of $1,600. To adjust the plan to fit the budget, we can consider alternative transportation options:\n\nAdjusted Day 1:\nTransportation: Self-driving, from Salt Lake City to Twin Falls, duration: 3 hours 13 mins, distance: 351 km, cost: $17 x 2 = $34 (for 2 people)\n\nAdjusted Day 3:\nTransportation: Self-driving, from Twin Falls to Salt Lake City, duration: 3 hours 14 mins, distance: 351 km, cost: $17 x 2 = $34 (for 2 people)\n\nAdjusted Total Cost:\nDay 1: $34 + $0 + $134 + $120 + $994 = $1282\nDay 2: $0 + $134 + $0 + $120 + $134 + $0 = $388\nDay 3: $34 + $134 + $0 + $0 + $0 + $0 = $168\n\nAdjusted Total Cost: $1282 + $388 + $168 = $1838\n\nThe adjusted plan still exceeds the budget. We need to find additional cost savings, such as choosing a less expensive accommodation or reducing meal costs. Unfortunately, without more options for accommodations and meals, it's challenging to fit the plan within the $1,600 budget while meeting all the requirements.", "gpt-4-1106-preview_direct_sole-planning_parsed_results": [{"days": 1, "current_city": "from Salt Lake City to Twin Falls", "transportation": "Flight Number: F3809095, from Salt Lake City to Twin Falls, Departure Time: 11:00, Arrival Time: 11:55", "breakfast": "-", "attraction": "Shoshone Falls Park, Twin Falls;", "lunch": "Asia Kitchen, Twin Falls", "dinner": "Fresc Co, Twin Falls", "accommodation": "Charming studio, great location!!!, Twin Falls"}, {"days": 2, "current_city": "Twin Falls", "transportation": "-", "breakfast": "Asia Kitchen, Twin Falls", "attraction": "Snake River Canyon Rim Trail, Twin Falls;Evel Knievel Snake River Canyon Jump Site, Twin Falls;", "lunch": "Food Fever, Twin Falls", "dinner": "Mr. Grill, Twin Falls", "accommodation": "Charming studio, great location!!!, Twin Falls"}, {"days": 3, "current_city": "from Twin Falls to Salt Lake City", "transportation": "Flight Number: F3807678, from Twin Falls to Salt Lake City, Departure Time: 12:35, Arrival Time: 13:20", "breakfast": "The Bake Studio, Twin Falls", "attraction": "Centennial Waterfront Park, Twin Falls;", "lunch": "-", "dinner": "-", "accommodation": "-"}]}]
