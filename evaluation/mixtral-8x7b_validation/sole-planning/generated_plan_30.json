[{"mixtral-8x7b_direct_sole-planning_results": " Sure, I'd be happy to help you plan your trip! Based on your preferences and the information provided, here is a suggested travel itinerary from Key West to Indiana and back within your budget of $2,000:\n\n1. **March 10, 2022 (Key West to South Bend, IN)**\n\t* Since there are no direct flights from Key West to Evansville or South Bend on March 10th, I suggest self-driving or taking a taxi from Key West to South Bend. The distance is approximately 2,406 km (1,503 miles) and would take around 22 hours and 38 minutes by car. If you choose to drive, consider breaking the journey into multiple days and stopping at cities along the way for overnight stays.\n\t* Alternatively, if you prefer flying, you can fly from Key West to a nearby major airport (such as Miami or Orlando) and then take a connecting flight to South Bend. However, this may be more expensive than self-driving or taking a taxi.\n2. **March 11-13, 2022 (Explore South Bend and Evansville, IN)**\n\t* Once you arrive in South Bend, there are plenty of things to see and do in the city. Some popular attractions include:\n\t\t+ The University of Notre Dame campus\n\t\t+ Studebaker National Museum\n\t\t+ South Bend Chocolate Company\n\t* You can also take a day trip to Evansville, which is about 3 hours and 45 minutes away by car. Some popular attractions in Evansville include:\n\t\t+ Mesker Park Zoo\n\t\t+ Reitz Home Museum\n\t\t+ Children's Museum of Evansville\n\t* For accommodations, there are a variety of options ranging from budget-friendly hotels to luxury resorts. Here are some suggestions:\n\t\t+ Just Right in Lovely Greenpoint - $614/night for a private room (minimum 7-night stay)\n\t\t+ Clean + Simple Chelsea 2 Bedroom (sleeps 7) - $341/night for an entire home/apt (maximum 30-night stay)\n\t\t+ Convenient 1Bdr with Outdoor Space (sleeps 4) - $825/night for an entire home/apt (minimum 2-night stay)\n3. **March 14, 2022 (South Bend, IN to Key West)**\n\t* Similar to the outbound journey, there are no direct flights from South Bend to Key West on March 14th. I suggest self-driving or taking a taxi back to Key West, which would take around 22 hours and 38 minutes by car. Alternatively, you can fly from South Bend to a nearby major airport (such as Miami or Orlando) and then take a connecting flight to Key West.\n\nBased on the itinerary above, here is an estimated breakdown of costs:\n\n* Transportation (self-driving or taxi): $1,200 (round trip from Key West to South Bend)\n* Accommodations: around $1,800 (based on a 3-night stay in South Bend and Evansville, with an average nightly rate of $600 for the Just Right in Lovely Greenpoint private room)\n* Attractions/activities: around $200 (based on general admission prices for various museums and attractions in South Bend and Evansville)\n\nTotal estimated cost: around $3,200. However, there are ways to reduce costs by choosing more budget-friendly accommodations or transportation options. Additionally, if you choose to fly instead of self-driving or taking a taxi, this would add additional costs to the itinerary.
