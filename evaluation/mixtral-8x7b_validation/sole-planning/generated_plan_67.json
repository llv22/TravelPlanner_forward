[{"mixtral-8x7b_direct_sole-planning_results": " Sure, I'd be happy to help you create a travel itinerary! Based on your requirements, here is a possible plan for your trip from Baton Rouge to Dallas from March 25th to March 27th, 2022.\n\n**Transportation:**\n- Departure: You can choose to fly or drive to Dallas. Here are some options:\n\t+ Flight: There are several flights from Baton Rouge to Dallas on March 25th. The prices range from $113 to $186, and the flight duration is about 1 hour and 30 minutes. You can choose the flight that best fits your schedule and budget.\n\t+ Self-driving: If you prefer driving, it will take approximately 6 hours and 15 minutes to reach Dallas from Baton Rouge, and the distance is 687 km. The estimated cost for self-driving is $34.\n\t+ Taxi: Alternatively, you can take a taxi to Dallas, which takes about the same time as driving but costs more. The estimated cost for a taxi ride from Baton Rouge to Dallas is $687.\n- Return: You can follow the same transportation options back to Baton Rouge on March 27th.\n\n**Accommodation:**\nBased on your requirement of smoking being permitted, I found the following accommodation options in Dallas:\n- Option 1: Luxury Private Room Near Downtown Dallas - $50/night for a private room that can accommodate up to 4 people, no smoking fee. This option is within your budget and has excellent reviews.\n- Option 2: Cozy Apartment in Downtown Dallas - $60/night for a one-bedroom apartment that can accommodate up to 4 people, smoking allowed with an additional fee of $50. This option may be slightly above your budget but is a great choice if you prefer having more space and privacy.\n- Option 3: Comfortable Room in Uptown Dallas - $45/night for a private room that can accommodate up to 2 people, smoking allowed with an additional fee of $20. This option is the most affordable but only has enough space for 2 people, so you would need to book two rooms if there are 4 of you.\n\n**Budget:**\nBased on the options mentioned above, here's a breakdown of the estimated cost:\n- Transportation: $113 (flight) or $34 (self-driving) for a round trip per person.\n- Accommodation: $50 to $60/night for 2 nights, depending on your choice of accommodation and number of rooms needed.\n- Total: $113 x 4 + $50 x 2 = $558 (flight) or $34 x 4 + $50 x 2 = $278 (self-driving).\n\nPlease note that these are estimated costs and may vary depending on the actual prices at the time of booking. The options mentioned above are subject to availability, so I recommend booking as soon as possible to secure your reservations.\n\nI hope this helps!
