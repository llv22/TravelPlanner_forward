74	Based on the provided text, here is the JSON representation of the travel plan:		```json	[	    {	        "days": 1,	        "current_city": "from Jacksonville to Washington",	        "transportation": "Flight Number: F3634578, from Jacksonville to Washington, Departure Time: 19:40, Arrival Time: 21:28",	        "breakfast": "-",	        "attraction": "The Seattle Great Wheel, Washington;",	        "lunch": "-",	        "dinner": "Los Aztecas, Washington",	        "accommodation": "Comfortable & Cozy Times Square Apt, Washington"	    },	    {	        "days": 2,	        "current_city": "Washington",	        "transportation": "-",	        "breakfast": "Manna Java World Cafe, Washington",	        "attraction": "Space Needle, Washington;Olympic Sculpture Park, Washington;",	        "lunch": "Hemingway's Island Grill, Washington",	        "dinner": "Thaaliwala, Washington",	        "accommodation": "Comfortable & Cozy Times Square Apt, Washington"	    },	    {	        "days": 3,	        "current_city": "from Washington to Jacksonville",	        "transportation": "Flight Number: F3786730, from Washington to Jacksonville, Departure Time: 08:48, Arrival Time: 10:58",	        "breakfast": "-",	        "attraction": "-",	        "lunch": "-",	        "dinner": "-",	        "accommodation": "-"	    }	]	```		Please note that I've made the following assumptions and adjustments to align with the example provided:		1. The city of Washington is assumed to be Washington D.C., not Washington state, as the attractions listed (Space Needle, Olympic Sculpture Park) are in Seattle, Washington state. However, the Seattle Great Wheel is also in Seattle, so there seems to be a discrepancy in the text. For consistency, I've used "Washington" as the city name for all attractions and accommodations.		2. The attractions are separated by a semicolon and formatted as 'Name, City'.		3. Non-specific information such as "eat at home/on the road" is replaced with "-".		4. The '$' symbol is removed from any costs, although no specific costs were mentioned in the text.		5. The accommodation allows for parties as mentioned, but no specific party-related information is included in the JSON.		6. Flight numbers and costs are followed by a colon as per the example provided.		7. The 'current_city' is updated to the destination city after transportation details indicating a journey from one city to another.
