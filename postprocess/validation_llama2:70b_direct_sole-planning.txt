Additionally, the "accommodation" field is marked as "-" because the text only mentions "a hotel of your choice" without specifying a name. The budget breakdown is not included in the JSON structure as it is a summary and not part of the day-to-day itinerary details. If you require the budget to be included in the JSON, please let me know, and I can add that information as well.
15	Based on the provided text, here is the reconstructed information in JSON format:		```json	[	    {	        "day": 1,	        "current_city": "from Spokane to San Francisco",	        "transportation": "Flight Number: F3818870, from Spokane to San Francisco, Departure Time: 17:38, Arrival Time: 19:54",	        "breakfast": "-",	        "attraction": "Fisherman's Wharf, San Francisco;Alcatraz Island, San Francisco;Golden Gate Park, San Francisco;",	        "lunch": "-",	        "dinner": "-",	        "accommodation": "Cozy room, Upper East Side, San Francisco"	    },	    {	        "day": 2,	        "current_city": "San Francisco",	        "transportation": "-",	        "breakfast": "Bebbe Da Degh, San Francisco",	        "attraction": "-",	        "lunch": "Chauhan Vatika, San Francisco",	        "dinner": "-",	        "accommodation": "Cozy room, Upper East Side, San Francisco"	    },	    {	        "day": 3,	        "current_city": "from San Francisco to Spokane",	        "transportation": "Flight Number: F3840215, from San Francisco to Spokane, Departure Time: 16:21, Arrival Time: 18:29",	        "breakfast": "-",	        "attraction": "-",	        "lunch": "-",	        "dinner": "-",	        "accommodation": "-"	    }	]	```		Please note that I've made the following assumptions and changes to fit the JSON format:		1. The 'current_city' has been updated to reflect the transportation details.	2. The 'attraction' field for Day 2 is left empty as the text does not specify particular attractions visited that day.	3. The 'breakfast', 'lunch', and 'dinner' fields are filled in only when specific restaurants are mentioned. Otherwise, they are marked with "-".	4. The 'accommodation' field for Day 3 is marked as "-" since the text indicates checking out.	5. Costs are removed from the JSON as they are not directly associated with the daily activities.	6. The budget breakdown is not included in the JSON as it is a summary and not part of the daily itinerary details.		Please adjust the JSON as needed if there are specific requirements or additional information to include.

The flights and the first day's accommodation suggest that the destination is Palm Springs, but the accommodation and attractions are listed in Brooklyn, New York. For the purpose of this JSON reconstruction, I have assumed that the 'current_city' is Palm Springs, as indicated by the flights, and that the attractions and meals are in Brooklyn, New York, as per the text. However, in a real-world scenario, this would need to be clarified for accuracy.

If you have specific details for these, you can replace the placeholders accordingly.
